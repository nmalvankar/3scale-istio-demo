## Application Storage Basics
If a pod in OpenShift needs reliable storage, for example, to host a database,
we would need to supply a **persistent** volume to the pod. This type of
storage outlives the container, i.e. it persists when the pod dies. It
typically comes from an external storage system.

[WARNING]
====
Doing these exercises requires that you already have deployed the application
featured in the Application Management Basics exercises. You should do those
exercises now before continuing.
====

The `mapit` application currently doesn't leverage any persistent storage. If
the pod dies, so does all the content inside the container.

We will talk about this concept in more detail later. But let's imagine for a
moment, the `mapit` application needs persistent storage available under the
`/app-storage` directory inside the container.

[NOTE]
====
The directories that make up the container's internal filesystem are a blend
of the read-only layers of the container image and the top-most writable
layer that is added as soon as a container instance is started from the
image. The writable layer is disposed of once the container is deleted which
can happen regularly in a dynamic container orchestration environment.
====

### Adding Persistent Volume Claims
Here's how you would instruct OpenShift to create a `PersistentVolume`
object, which represents external, persistent storage, and have it *mounted*
inside the container's filesystem:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set volume dc/mapit --add --name=mapit-storage -t pvc --claim-mode=ReadWriteOnce --claim-size=1Gi --claim-name=mapit-storage --mount-path=/app-storage
----

The output looks like this:

----
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/mapit volume updated
----

In the first step a *PersistentVolumeClaim* was created. This object
represents a request for storage of a certain kind, with a certain capacity
from the user to OpenShift.

Next the `DeploymentConfig` of `mapit` is updated to reference this storage
and make it available under the `/app-storage` directory inside the pod.

You can see the new `DeploymentConfig` like this:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get dc mapit
----

The output will show that a new revision was created as part of the update with storage.

----
NAME      REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
mapit     4          1         1         config,image(mapit:latest)
----

Likely, depending when you ran the command you may or may not see that the new pod is still being spawned:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pod
----

----
NAME             READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
mapit-3-ntd9w    1/1       Running             0          9m
mapit-4-d872b    0/1       ContainerCreating   0          5s
mapit-4-deploy   1/1       Running             0          10s
----

Take a look at the `DeploymentConfig` now:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe dc mapit
----

You will see there is now both `Mounts` and `Volumes` details about the new storage:

----
...
    Mounts:
      /app-storage from mapit-storage (rw)
  Volumes:
   mapit-storage:
    Type:	PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)
    ClaimName:	mapit-storage
    ReadOnly:	false
....
----

But what is happening under the covers?

### Storage Classes
When OpenShift 4 was first installed, a dynamic storage provider for AWS EBS
was configured. You can see this `StorageClass` with the following:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get storageclass
----

And you will see something like:

----
NAME            PROVISIONER             AGE
gp2 (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   4d4h
----

Any time a request for a volume is made (`PersistentVolumeClaim`) that
doesn't specify a `StorageClass`, the default will be used. In this case, the
default is an EBS provisioner that will create an EBS GP2 volume of the
requested size (in our example, 1Gi).

### Persistent Volume (Claims)
The command you ran earlier referenced a `claim`. Storage in a Kubernetes
environment uses a system of volume claims and volumes. A user makes a
`PersistentVolumeClaim` and Kubernetes tries to find a `PersistentVolume`
that matches. In the case where a volume does not already exist, if there is
a dynamic provisioner that satisfies the claim, a `PersistentVolume` is
created.

Execute the following:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get persistentvolume
----

You will see something like the following:

----
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                          STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
pvc-9ac61701-5d56-11e9-9fbd-0a1014b36356   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    app-management/mapit-storage   gp2                     114s
----
This is the volume that was created as a result of your earlier claim. Note
that the volume is *bound* to the claim that exists in the `app-management`
project.

Now, execute:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get persistentvolumeclaim -n app-management
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME            STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
mapit-storage   Bound    pvc-9ac61701-5d56-11e9-9fbd-0a1014b36356   1Gi        RWO            gp2            32m
----

### Testing Persistent Storage

Get the name of your pod using `oc get pods` and then log on to the pod using
the remote-shell capability of the `oc` client:

[source,none,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc rsh mapit-4-d872b
----

*Being in the container's shell session*, list the content of the root
directory from the perspective of the container's namespace:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
ls -ahl /
----

You will see a directory there called `/app-storage`:

<1> This is where the persistent storage appears inside the container

Amazon EBS volumes are read-write-once. In other words, because they are
block storage, they may only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time, which
means that only one container can use an EBS-based `PersistentVolume` at a
time. In other words: read-write-once.

Execute the following inside the remote shell session:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
echo "Hello World from OpenShift" > /app-storage/hello.txt
exit
----

Then, make sure your file is present:

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc rsh mapit-4-t4mnv cat /app-storage/hello.txt
----

Now, to verify that persistent storage really works, delete your pod:

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc delete pod mapit-4-t4mnv && oc get pod
----

After some time, your new pod will be ready and running. Find its name, and
again check the file:

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc rsh mapit-4-lpqd5 cat /app-storage/hello.txt
----

It's still there. In fact, the new pod may not even be running on the same
node as the old pod, which means that, under the covers, Kubernetes and
OpenShift automatically attached the real, external storage to the right
place at the right time.

If you needed read-write-many storage, file-based storage solutions can
provide it. OpenShift Container Storage is a hyperconverged storage solution
that can run inside OpenShift and provide file, block and even object storage
by turning locally attached storage devices into storage pools and then
creating volumes out of them.
