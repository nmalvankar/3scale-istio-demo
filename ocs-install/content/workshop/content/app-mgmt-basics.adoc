## Application Management Basics
In this module, you will deploy a sample application using the `oc` tool and
learn about some of the core concepts, fundamental objects, and basics of
application management on OpenShift Container Platform.

### Core OpenShift Concepts
As a future administrator of OpenShift, it is important to understand several
core building blocks as it relates to applications. Understanding these building
blocks will help you better see the big picture of application management on the
platform.

### Projects
A *Project* is a "bucket" of sorts. It's a meta construct where all of a
user's resources live. From an administrative perspective, each *Project* can
be thought of like a tenant. *Projects* may have multiple users who can
access them, and users may be able to access multiple *Projects*. Technically
speaking, a user doesn't own the resources, the *Project* does. Deleting the
user doesn't affect any of the created resources.

For this exercise, first create a *Project* to hold some resources:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project app-management
----

### Deploy a Sample Application
The `new-app` command provides a very simple way to tell OpenShift to run
things. You simply provide it with one of a wide array of inputs, and it figures
out what to do. Users will commonly use this command to get OpenShift to launch
existing images, to create builds of source code and ultimately deploy them, to
instantiate templates, and so on.

You will now launch a specific image that exists on Dockerhub

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app quay.io/thoraxe/mapit
----

The output will look like:

----
--> Found Docker image 7ce7ade (20 months old) from quay.io for "quay.io/thoraxe/mapit"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "mapit:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "mapit"
    * Ports 8080/tcp, 8778/tcp, 9779/tcp will be load balanced by service "mapit"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "mapit"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "mapit" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "mapit" created
    service "mapit" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/mapit'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

You can see that OpenShift automatically created several resources as the output
of this command. We will take some time to explore the resources that were
created.

For more information on the capabilities of `new-app`, take a look at its help
message by running `oc new-app -h`.

### Pods

.OpenShift Pods
image::images/openshift_pod.png[]

Pods are one or more containers deployed together on a host. A pod is the
smallest compute unit you can define, deploy and manage in OpenShift. Each pod is allocated
its own internal IP address on the SDN and owns the entire port range. The
containers within pods can share local storage space and networking resources.

Pods are treated as **static** objects by OpenShift, i.e., one cannot change the
pod definition while running.

You can get a list of pods:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods
----

And you will see something like the following:

----
NAME             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mapit-1-5qmgw    1/1     Running     0          24s
mapit-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          32s
----

NOTE: Pod names are dynamically generated as part of the deployment process,
which you will learn about shortly. Your name will be slightly different.

NOTE: The `-deploy` pod is related to the `DeploymentConfig` which will be discussed later.

The `describe` command will give you more information on the details of a pod.
In the case of the pod name above:

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc describe pod mapit-1-5qmgw
----

And you will see output similar to the following:

----

This is a more detailed description of the pod that is running. You can see what
node the pod is running on, the internal IP address of the pod, various labels,
and other information about what is going on.

### Services
.OpenShift Service
image::images/openshift_service.png[]

*Services* provide a convenient abstraction layer inside OpenShift to find a
group of like *Pods*. They also act as an internal proxy/load balancer between
those *Pods* and anything else that needs to access them from inside the
OpenShift environment. For example, if you needed more `mapit` instances to
handle the load, you could spin up more *Pods*. OpenShift automatically maps
them as endpoints to the *Service*, and the incoming requests would not notice
anything different except that the *Service* was now doing a better job handling
the requests.

When you asked OpenShift to run the image, the `new-app` command
automatically created a *Service* for you. Remember that services are an
internal construct. They are not available to the "outside world", or
anything that is outside the OpenShift environment. That's OK, as you will
learn later.

The way that a *Service* maps to a set of *Pods* is via a system of *Labels* and
*Selectors*. *Services* are assigned a fixed IP address and many ports and
protocols can be mapped.

There is a lot more information about
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[Services],
including the YAML format to make one by hand, in the official documentation.

You can see the current list of services in a project with:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get services
----

You will see something like the following:

----
NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
mapit     ClusterIP   172.30.48.204   <none>        8080/TCP,8778/TCP,9779/TCP   3m
----

NOTE: Service IP addresses are dynamically assigned on creation and are
immutable. The IP of a service will never change, and the IP is reserved until
the service is deleted. Your service IP will likely be different.

Just like with pods, you can `describe` services, too. In fact, you can
`describe` most objects in OpenShift:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe service mapit
----

You will see something like the following:

----
Name:              mapit
Namespace:         app-management
Labels:            app=mapit
Annotations:       openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewApp
Selector:          app=mapit,deploymentconfig=mapit
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                172.30.1.208
Port:              8080-tcp  8080/TCP
TargetPort:        8080/TCP
Endpoints:         10.128.4.13:8080
Port:              8778-tcp  8778/TCP
TargetPort:        8778/TCP
Endpoints:         10.128.4.13:8778
Port:              9779-tcp  9779/TCP
TargetPort:        9779/TCP
Endpoints:         10.128.4.13:9779
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
----

Information about all objects (their definition, their state, and so forth) is
stored in the etcd datastore. etcd stores data as key/value pairs, and all of
this data can be represented as serializable data objects (JSON, YAML).

Take a look at the YAML output for the service:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get service mapit -o yaml
----

You will see something like the following:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewApp
  creationTimestamp: 2019-04-08T19:38:45Z

  name: mapit
  namespace: app-management
  resourceVersion: "189058"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/app-management/services/mapit
  uid: ec6ab96f-5a35-11e9-97f0-0a1014b36356
spec:
  clusterIP: 172.30.1.208
  ports:
  - name: 8080-tcp
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: 8778-tcp
    port: 8778
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8778
  - name: 9779-tcp
    port: 9779
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9779
  selector:
    app: mapit
    deploymentconfig: mapit
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
----

Take note of the `selector` stanza. Remember it.

It is also of interest to view the YAML of the *Pod* to understand how OpenShift
wires components together. Go back and find the name of your `mapit` *Pod*, and
then execute the following:

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc get pod mapit-1-5qmgw -o yaml
----

Under the `metadata` section you should see the following:

----
  labels:
    app: mapit
    deployment: mapit-1
    deploymentconfig: mapit
  name: mapit-1-5qmgw
----

* The *Service* has a `selector` stanza that refers to `app: mapit` and
  `deploymentconfig: mapit`.
* The *Pod* has multiple *Labels*:
** `deploymentconfig: mapit`
** `app: mapit`
** `deployment: mapit-1`

*Labels* are just key/value pairs. Any *Pod* in this *Project* that has a *Label* that
matches the *Selector* will be associated with the *Service*. If you look at the
`describe` output again, you will see that there is one endpoint for the
service: the existing `mapit` *Pod*.

The default behavior of `new-app` is to create just one instance of the item
requested. We will see how to modify/adjust this in a moment, but there are a
few more concepts to learn first.

### Background: Deployment Configurations and Replication Controllers

While *Services* provide routing and load balancing for *Pods*, which may go in
and out of existence, *ReplicationControllers* (RC) are used to specify and then
ensure the desired number of *Pods* (replicas) are in existence. For example, if
you always want an application to be scaled to 3 *Pods* (instances), a
*ReplicationController* is needed. Without an RC, any *Pods* that are killed or
somehow die/exit are not automatically restarted. *ReplicationControllers* are
how OpenShift "self heals".

A *DeploymentConfiguration* (DC) defines how something in OpenShift should be
deployed. From the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html[deployments documentation^]:

----
Building on replication controllers, OpenShift adds expanded support for the
software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept of deployments.
In the simplest case, a deployment just creates a new replication controller and
lets it start up pods. However, OpenShift deployments also provide the ability
to transition from an existing deployment of an image to a new one and also
define hooks to be run before or after creating the replication controller.
----

In almost all cases, you will end up using the *Pod*, *Service*,
*ReplicationController* and *DeploymentConfiguration* resources together. And, in
almost all of those cases, OpenShift will create all of them for you.

There are some edge cases where you might want some *Pods* and an *RC* without a *DC*
or a *Service*, and others, but these are advanced topics not covered in these
exercises.

### Exploring Deployment-related Objects

Now that we know the background of what a *ReplicatonController* and
*DeploymentConfig* are, we can explore how they work and are related. Take a
look at the *DeploymentConfig* (DC) that was created for you when you told
OpenShift to stand up the `mapit` image:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get dc
----

You will see something like the following:

----
NAME      REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
mapit     1          1         1         config,image(mapit:latest)
----

To get more details, we can look into the *ReplicationController* (*RC*).

Take a look at the *ReplicationController* (RC) that was created for you when
you told OpenShift to stand up the `mapit` image:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get rc
----

You will see something like the following:

----
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
mapit-1   1         1         1         4h
----

This lets us know that, right now, we expect one *Pod* to be deployed
(`Desired`), and we have one *Pod* actually deployed (`Current`). By changing
the desired number, we can tell OpenShift that we want more or less *Pods*.

### Scaling the Application

Let's scale our mapit "application" up to 2 instances. We can do this with
the `scale` command.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc scale --replicas=2 dc/mapit
----

To verify that we changed the number of replicas, issue the following command:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get rc
----

You will see something like the following:

----
NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
mapit-1      2         2         1         4h
----

You can see that we now have 2 replicas. Let's verify the number of pods with
the `oc get pods` command:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods
----

You will see something like the following:

----
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mapit-1-6lczv   1/1       Running   0          4h
mapit-1-rq6t6   1/1       Running   0          1m
----

And lastly, let's verify that the *Service* that we learned about in the
previous lab accurately reflects two endpoints:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe svc mapit
----

You will see something like the following:

----
Name:              mapit
Namespace:         app-management
Labels:            app=mapit
Annotations:       openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
Selector:          app=mapit,deploymentconfig=mapit
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                172.30.48.204
Port:              8080-tcp  8080/TCP
TargetPort:        8080/TCP
Endpoints:         10.129.0.2:8080,10.130.0.3:8080
Port:              8778-tcp  8778/TCP
TargetPort:        8778/TCP
Endpoints:         10.129.0.2:8778,10.130.0.3:8778
Port:              9779-tcp  9779/TCP
TargetPort:        9779/TCP
Endpoints:         10.129.0.2:9779,10.130.0.3:9779
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>

----

Another way to look at a *Service*'s endpoints is with the following:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get endpoints mapit
----

And you will see something like the following:

----
NAME      ENDPOINTS                                                     AGE
mapit     10.128.2.3:9779,10.129.0.3:9779,10.128.2.3:8080 + 3 more...   4h
----

Your IP addresses will likely be different, as each pod receives a unique IP
within the OpenShift environment. The endpoint list is a quick way to see how
many pods are behind a service.

Overall, that's how simple it is to scale an application (*Pods* in a
*Service*). Application scaling can happen extremely quickly because OpenShift
is just launching new instances of an existing image, especially if that image
is already cached on the node.

One last thing to note is that there are actually several ports defined on this
*Service*. Earlier we said that a pod gets a single IP and has control of the
entire port space on that IP. While something running inside the *Pod* may listen
on multiple ports (single container using multiple ports, individual containers
using individual ports, a mix), a *Service* can actually proxy/map ports to
different places.

For example, a *Service* could listen on port 80 (for legacy reasons) but the
*Pod* could be listening on port 8080, 8888, or anything else.

In this `mapit` case, the image we ran has several `EXPOSE` statements in the
`Dockerfile`, so OpenShift automatically created ports on the service and mapped
them into the *Pods*.

### Application "Self Healing"

Because OpenShift's *RCs* are constantly monitoring to see that the desired number
of *Pods* are actually running, you might also expect that OpenShift will "fix" the
situation if it is ever not right. You would be correct!

Since we have two *Pods* running right now, let's see what happens if we
"accidentally" kill one. Run the `oc get pods` command again, and choose a *Pod*
name. Then, do the following:

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc delete pod mapit-1-6lczv && oc get pods
----

And you will see something like the following:

----
pod "mapit-1-lhqgq" deleted
NAME            READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
mapit-1-7dw5t   1/1       Running             0          3m
mapit-1-rgnht   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          2s
----

Did you notice anything? There's a new container already being created.

Also, the `ContainerCreating` *Pod* has a different name. That's because
OpenShift almost immediately detected that the current state (1 *Pod*,
because one was deleted) didn't match the desired state (2 *Pods*), and it
fixed it by scheduling another *Pod*.

### Background: Routes
.OpenShift Route
image::images/openshift_route.png[]

While *Services* provide internal abstraction and load balancing within an
OpenShift environment, sometimes clients (users, systems, devices, etc.)
**outside** of OpenShift need to access an application. The way that external
clients are able to access applications running in OpenShift is through the
OpenShift routing layer. And the data object behind that is a *Route*.

The default OpenShift router (HAProxy) uses the HTTP header of the incoming
request to determine where to proxy the connection. You can optionally define
security, such as TLS, for the *Route*. If you want your *Services* (and by
extension, your *Pods*) to be accessible to the outside world, then you need to
create a *Route*.

Do you remember setting up the router? You probably don't. That's because the
installation deployed an Operator for the router, and the operator created a
router for you! The router lives in the `openshift-ingress`
*Project*, and you can see information about it with the following command:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe deployment router-default -n openshift-ingress
----

NOTE: A *Deployment* is a Kubernetes native object, whereas a
*DeploymentConfig* is an OpenShift-specific object with a few extra features,
namely around `triggers` and what caues new deployments to take place.

You will explore the Operator for the router more in a subsequent exercise.

### Creating a Route
Creating a *Route* is a pretty straight-forward process.  You simply `expose`
the *Service* via the command line. If you remember from earlier, your *Service*
name is `mapit`. With the *Service* name, creating a *Route* is a simple
one-command task:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc expose service mapit
----

You will see:

----
route.route.openshift.io/mapit exposed
----

Verify the *Route* was created with the following command:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get route
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME    HOST/PORT                                                           PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
mapit   mapit-app-management.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}              mapit      8080-tcp
----

If you take a look at the `HOST/PORT` column, you'll see a familiar looking
FQDN. The default behavior of OpenShift is to expose services on a formulaic
hostname:

`{SERVICENAME}-{PROJECTNAME}.{ROUTINGSUBDOMAIN}`

In the subsequent router Operator labs we'll explore this and other
configuration options.

While the router configuration specifies the domain(s) that the router should
listen for, something still needs to get requests for those domains to the
Router in the first place. There is a wildcard DNS entry that points
`+*.apps...+` to the host where the router lives. OpenShift concatenates the
*Service* name, *Project* name, and the routing subdomain to create this
FQDN/URL.

You can visit this URL using your browser, or using `curl`, or any other tool.
It should be accessible from anywhere on the internet.

The *Route* is associated with the *Service*, and the router automatically
proxies connections directly to the *Pod*. The router itself runs as a *Pod*. It
bridges the "real" internet to the SDN.

If you take a step back to examine everything you've done so far, in three
commands you deployed an application, scaled it, and made it accessible to the
outside world:

----
oc new-app quay.io/thoraxe/mapit
oc scale --replicas=2 dc/mapit
oc expose service mapit
----

### Scale Down
Before we continue, go ahead and scale your application down to a single
instance:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc scale --replicas=1 dc/mapit
----

### Application Probes
OpenShift provides rudimentary capabilities around checking the liveness and/or
readiness of application instances. If the basic checks are insufficient,
OpenShift also allows you to run a command inside the *Pod*/container in order
to perform the check. That command could be a complicated script that uses any
language already installed inside the container image.

There are two types of application probes that can be defined:

*Liveness Probe*

A liveness probe checks if the container in which it is configured is still
running. If the liveness probe fails, the container is killed, which will be
subjected to its restart policy.

*Readiness Probe*

A readiness probe determines if a container is ready to service requests. If the
readiness probe fails, the endpoint's controller ensures the container has its IP
address removed from the endpoints of all services that should match it. A
readiness probe can be used to signal to the endpoint's controller that even
though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic.

More information on probing applications is available in the
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/nodes/containers/nodes-containers-health.html[Application
Health] section of the documentation.

### Add Probes to the Application
The `oc set` command can be used to perform several different functions, one of
which is creating and/or modifying probes. The `mapit` application exposes an
endpoint which we can check to see if it is alive and ready to respond. You can
test it using `curl`:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl mapit-app-management.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/health
----

You will get some JSON as a response:

[source,json]
----
{"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":10724835328,"free":10257825792,"threshold":10485760}}
----

We can ask OpenShift to probe this endpoint for liveness with the following
command:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set probe dc/mapit --liveness --get-url=http://:8080/health --initial-delay-seconds=30
----

You can then see that this probe is defined in the `oc describe` output:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe dc mapit
----

You will see a section like:

----
...
  Containers:
   mapit:
    Image:		quay.io/thoraxe/mapit@sha256:8c7e0349b6a016e3436416f3c54debda4594ba09fd34b8a0dee0c4497102590d
    Ports:		9779/TCP, 8080/TCP, 8778/TCP
    Host Ports:		0/TCP, 0/TCP, 0/TCP
    Liveness:		http-get http://:8080/health delay=30s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
    Environment:	<none>
    Mounts:		<none>
  Volumes:		<none>
...
----

Similarly, you can set a readiness probe in the same manner:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set probe dc/mapit --readiness --get-url=http://:8080/health --initial-delay-seconds=30
----

### Examining DeploymentConfigs and ReplicationControllers

Execute the following:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods
----

You should see something like:

----
NAME             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mapit-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          18h
mapit-2-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          112s
mapit-3-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          75s
mapit-3-kkwxq    1/1     Running     0          66s
----

Notice that there are 3 `-deploy` pods? And that the name of the current
`mapit` pod has the number 3 in it? This is because each change to the
*DeploymentConfig* is counted as a _configuration_ change, which _triggered_ a
new _deployment_. The `-deploy` pod is responsible for ensuring the new
deployment happens.

Execute the following:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deploymentconfigs
----

You should see something like:

----
NAME    REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
mapit   3          1         1         config,image(mapit:latest)
----

You made two material configuration changes after the initial deployment,
thus you are now on the third revision of the *DeploymentConfiguration*.

Execute the following:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get replicationcontrollers
----

You should see something like:

----
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
mapit-1   0         0         0       18h
mapit-2   0         0         0       5m14s
mapit-3   1         1         1       4m37s
----

Each time a new deployment is triggered, the deployer pod creates a new
*ReplicationController* which then is responsible for ensuring that pods
exist. Notice that the old RCs have a desired scale of zero, and the most
recent RC has a desired scale of 1.

If you `oc describe` each of these RCs you will see how `-1` has no probes,
and then `-2` and `-3` have the new probes, respectively.
